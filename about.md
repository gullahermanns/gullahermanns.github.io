	<h1 class="pageTitle">About</h1>
	<p class="intro">My name is Guðlaug Hermannsdóttir but nobody outside my home country has been able to pronounce it correctly so you can call me Gulla.</p>
	<p>I was born in a small Icelandic town just south of the Arctic Circle. My first job was planting trees into plastic pots with my horticulturist grandfather; currently I’m a freelance writer and photographer fascinated with the forests lacking in my home country. As I thought other things were lacking there as well, I decided it was time to relocate. I have since lived in London, Stockholm, New York, San Francisco, Maine, and Paris, searching for a spot to call home, suspecting I was homesick for a place that doesn’t exist. But as I am extremely nostalgic, constantly claiming that I was born in the wrong decade, it could also be the longing for a time already passed. An amalgam of various periods and cultures, post-modernism in the flesh, I have come to the conclusion that it is not the location but the participation that keeps one content, the subjective experiences rather than the objective achievements.</p>
